Thoughts:

- BookingController 

- This BookingController is using for manging bookings in system.I have break down the class in following as per my analysis:

  - Namespace and Use Statement: 
    - The code is organized within a namespace 'DTApi\Http\Controllers', which is a good practice to avoid using full namespace path in your code like we do like this :'DTApi\Http\Controllers', we'll only use alias in our code.
    - It imports several class from different namespaces such as 'request','BookingRepository', 'job', and 'Distance' which are using in the controller class.
    
  - Constructor:
    - The constructor injects an instance of 'BookingRepository' into controller, following the dependency injection principle which is a good practice to initialize data variable for whole class.
    
  - Index Function:
    - This function is handling for booking listing feature. 
    - It's check if user_id is existing then it's returning user's job data otherwise it'll check for admin or super admin role id then return all jobs.
    - There's also the use of env() to fetch value from environment file.
    
  - Show Function:
    - In this function, it'll fetch records based on id with related translater and user information.
    
  - Store function:
    - It'll handle creation of new job based on the submitted data and auth user.
    - At the end it'll return a response.
    
  - Update Function:
    - It will update the job based on user id and data if user is authenticated.
    - At the end it'll send a response.
    
  - immediateJobEmail Function:
    - This function first get admin email from config.
    - then get user data from request.
    - Then will call to repository method to store user data or send email to user with the user data.
    
  - GetHistory Function:
    - This function will check if user_id exist then it'll call repository function with user id and request data.
    - then send response back.
    
  - AcceptJob Function:
    - It'll accept user request data and then pass on this data to acceptJob function.
    - Then send response back.
    
  - AcceptJobWithId Function:
    - This function send job_id to acceptJobWithId repository function.
    - Then response back.
    
  - CancelJob Function:
    - This function will call CancelJobAjax repository method with $request data.
    - Then get response and send it to back.
    
  - EndJob Function:
    - This function will sen d request data to endJob repository method.
    - Then send response back.
    
  - CustomerNotCall Function:
    - It'll call customerNotCall repository method with user data.
    - Then send response back.
    
  - GetPotentialJobs Function:
    - It'll call getPotentialJobs repository method with user data.
    - Then send response back.
    
  - Reopen Function:
    - It'll call reopen repository method with user data.
    - Return response.
    
  - ResendNotification function:
    - It'll first get data from request and then find job by jobid.
    - then will get job data.
    - then pass job, job_data, and * to repo method.
    - then finally will send response of success.
    
  - ResendSMSNotifications Function:
    - It'll first get data from request and then find job by jobid.
    - then will get job data.
    - then apply try catch block to handle exception.
    - in that block, sending call to repo method to send sms.
    - if it's successfully then ill throw a success response otherwise a exception.
    
  - distanceFeed function:
    - It'll first get data from request.
    - Then will check for distance, time, jobid, session_time,flagged, manually_handle, by_admin, admincomment if they are empty or not.
    - Then will check if time or distance are not empty then it will get distance from database table4 distance.
    - then it will check if "$admincomment || $session || $flagged || $manually_handled || $by_admin" either of them is true then it will update job table based on jobid.
    - Then send response back.


Overall, the code seems to be well structure and follows the laravel conventions. There's some key point to improve further this code as follows:

- We don't need to create different function for the same task for example for AcceptJob, EndJob, CancelJob, and AcceptJobWithId etc. 
- we can handle all of these task within single function i think.
- Add proper comments.
- we can use swagger package for proper documentation of our code.
- There's no proper validation checks in the code.
- There should be a proper request file where we can handle its validation.
- For ajax request, there should be a condition to check if it's an ajax request or not to amke the method more reliable and dynamically handle things.
- we can wrap up notification function in one function instead of using two different function.
- Almost all functions are using same kind of code. the only difference is repository method name. we can handle this dynamically to remove duplication from the code.
- You're also not handling when user hit to database and then get response if that is successfully or not.
- Index method:
  - This method is the method of listing. this should not accept any parameter as it should be get request. if you need to get parameter then you can use request() object to get parameter from url.
  - Directly fetching value from env is not recommended thing. you should define a key in config and get values from config.
  - If you got data in response then first check.
- Show Method:
  - When you are finding data using find() method then you should check if you are able to get data or not then based on that send response otherwise an exception can be occurred.
- Store/update method:
    - Check last insert id in case of store then send response based on the inserted id.
    - apply validation before processing in controller.
- immediateJobEmail/acceptJob/ method:
  - Check data before sending response
  - applyu validation
- acceptJobWithId method
  - check if id available
  - appluyy validation
  - check response
- same is the case for all other methods.
